Hello!

So, basically I finished all the tasks, I pushed and committed all the code and resources from this project. I tried to comment all the code I added to the project. You will see some modifies in GameSystem.cs and Target.cs. Those were for the slow-motion effect.

I know it's not perfect, but I am very proud of it, because it is kinda my first small to medium project in Unity. I enjoyed it very much.

I would like to learn more because it was a really nice experience and a BIG CHALLENGE. 

Hope you will see all the work I have done, and maybe you can give me feedback for it, it will help me a lot.

Thank you! 

Have a great day!
